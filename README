About this project:
-------------------

This project is an attempt to rewrite the engine behind The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil (EoSD),
a popular danmaku (bullet hell) game published for Windows by Team Shanghai Alice in 2002.
Although the main reason behind this project is sheer curiosity, other motivations are portability and extendability.
Additionally, this project aims for a perfect compatibility with the official game, and thus become some sort of reference implementation.

Dependencies:
-------------

   *python
   *python3
   *glfw
   *sdl2
   *sdl2_image
   *sdl2_mixer
   *sdl2_ttf
   *libepoxy
   *libgl
Build instructions:
#Download the devel/dev and regular files of the ones listed above
>hg clone https://hg.linkmauve.fr/touhou
>cd touhou
>python3 setup.py build
>python3 setup.py install (or add sudo to have it installed for all users)
PORTABLE BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
#After cding into the touhou directory follow the listed below commands
>python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
>python3 ./scripts/pytouhou
Running:
in the directory of the game files locate all the files that have off characters and type this command
>convmv -r --nosmart --notest -f shiftjis -t UTF8 *.file-extension-name
(ex:) convmv -r --nosmart --notest -f shiftjis -t UTF8 *.DAT
if you don't have convmv you can easily get it on any linux platform here:
https://j3e.de/linux/convmv/
then do a simple extraction and installation:
>tar -xvf convmv-2.05.tar.gz
>cd convmv-2.05
>sudo cp convmv /usr/bin/
>sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/convmv 
Now finally to run the game simply cd into the directory where touhou 6 is kept and run pytouhou
(to not see any terminal output do pytouhou & disown and close your terminal window) 

Documentation:
--------------

The code should be sufficiently documented for anyone interested to learn how the EoSD engine work,
but additional documentation is available at:
